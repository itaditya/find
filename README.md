## What is it ?
 It's an easy way to share most of your profile links like Linkedin,Github,Fb,Twitter etc. with everyone just by telling your username.
 Eg :- My username is *adi*. Now my base link is <hosting.com>/adi. After this I can access all the profiles linked with it, like
  * facebook with <hosting.com>/adi/f or <hosting.com>/adi/facebook 
  * github with <hosting.com>/adi/g or <hosting.com>/adi/github 
  and so on

  This is especially helpful when you come across new people in Meetups and Hackathons and want to connect with everyone but obviously you don't remember what was the username of your fb account , linkedin account or maybe even github.
  Other use cases are -
  * Easily fill forms which require multiple profile urls. By using *find* you just change the last character and _bam_!
  * Contact a person on different platforms just by knowing his username.
  * Quickly fill resume and other forms where you need to mention your social links.
  * It serves as a multifunctional url shortener for all your profiles.
  * *Find* even let's you access your profile pic so you don't need to login at unsecure places just to download your picture for Documents purpose.

 And the best part is *no signups and no delay between redirects!* PS: I hate ads too.
