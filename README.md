## What is it ?
 It's an easy to share most of your profile links like Linkedin,Github,Fb,Twitter etc. with everyone just by telling your username.
 Eg :- My username is *adi*. Now my base link is <hosting.com>/adi. After this I can access all the profiles linked with it, like
  * facebook with <hosting.com>/adi/f or <hosting.com>/adi/facebook 
  * github with <hosting.com>/adi/g or <hosting.com>/adi/github 
  and so on

  This is especially helpful when you come across new people in Meetups and Hackathons and want to connect with everyone but obviously you don't remember what was the username of your fb account , linkedin account or maybe even github.

## Steps

 1. Use `touch .env` to make .env file in root directory.
 2. Run `npm install`.
 3. Use  `npm i nodemon -g` to install nodemon globally.
 4. Configure your mongodb and start it.
 5. Use command `npm start` to start server in development mode.
